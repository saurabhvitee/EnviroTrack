# EnviroTrack
## Project Summary:
The EnviroTrack is a user-friendly app designed to help individuals monitor and understand their personal carbon footprint. The app provides personalized suggestions for reducing carbon emissions, covering various aspects of one's lifestyle, including transportation, energy consumption, food, and product purchases. By tracking and analyzing data, users can see their impact on the environment and receive actionable tips to live more sustainably.

## Problem:
Climate change is significantly driven by greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, which disrupt the natural balance and trap heat in the atmosphere. This leads to global warming, resulting in rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and ecosystem disruptions. Everyday activities such as transportation, energy use, and consumption habits contribute to the carbon footprint, exacerbating environmental issues.

## Solution:
The EnviroTrack addresses this problem by providing tools to track carbon emissions, offering eco-friendly tips, and integrating carbon offsetting initiatives. It helps users make informed decisions to minimize their environmental impact, thereby contributing to a greener future.

## Major Tech Stack Used:

- Frontend: React Native (for mobile app development)
- Backend: Node.js with Express (for server-side logic)
- Database: MongoDB (to manage user data and carbon emission records)
- APIs: Integration with third-party services like Fitbit, Uber, Amazon, and Zomato for data collection
- Machine Learning: AI algorithms for personalized recommendations

## Project Output:
The goal of the Carbon Footprint Tracker is to help users understand how their daily choices affect the environment. By providing insights and suggestions, it encourages a more sustainable lifestyle for a healthier planet. Users can set goals, track their progress, and contribute to eco-friendly projects to offset their carbon footprint.
